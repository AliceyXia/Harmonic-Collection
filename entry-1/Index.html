  <h3><b>⦿ Basic Background Introduction ⦿</b></h3>

  <p> By a simple defination, <b>Artificial Intelligence Art (AI Art)</b> is an new create genre 
    that has emerged as a result of recent developments in computer vision and deep learning.
    It's progress has been facilitated in particular by the widespread use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
    a class of machine learning established by researcher Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>AI Art</b> is any work of art made with the help of an artificial intelligence-based system 
    and falls under the umbrella of Generative Art.The latter denotes art made, in whole or in part,
    with the assistance of a (typically) non-human system capable of autonomously 
    selecting the attributes of an artwork without the artist's direct interaction.
