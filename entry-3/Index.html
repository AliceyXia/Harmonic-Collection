    <h3>Insight</h3>
    <p>
        Thinking about the fairy tale I read as a child, Little Red Riding Hood came into my mind.
        Entering the prompt:<b>Little Red Riding Hood in the woods</b>, the outcome of the images looks a little creepy.
        The face of the little red riding hood is just blank, but the atmosphere of the images is very nice, which gives a weird 
        contrast and makes the images became very attractive to look at. Because the AI can't produce things specifically if you don't have
        a clear prompt and wordings. So if I specified the prompt, such as suggesting the facial details, and the environment surrondings.
        Then, the image being produced will be more specific and will not have a creepy atmosphere.
